========

1. Download the google analytics data from: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/7710864/jhsph753/assignments/gaData.rda
2. You have data on the total visits to the Wordpress and Tumblr sites. You also have the subset of visits that
were referred through Twitter. 
3. There is a slow increase in the average traffic to the site, puncuated by spikes in traffic. The goal of your
analysis is to calculate the expected fraction of visitors we retain from each spike and if there are any factors
that influence the fraction of visitors we retain. 
4. You should submit your report/code to reproduce your analysis by email to myself and Parichoy. 
5. The title of your email **must** be: 753 - Data Analysis Two - [your last name] or it will not count for credit
