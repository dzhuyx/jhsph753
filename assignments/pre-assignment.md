Pre Assignment

1. Use the data at: /home/bst/faculty/jleek/jhsph753/CCdata.csv to tell me something interesting about me. 
2. Suppose I observe random variables X_{ij(i)} where i indicates the variable 1,..n and j(i) is the j'th time point for variable i. How would you use the data from time points 1(1)...1((i-1)) to predict the value of X_{11(i)}. Would you do anything different if all the variables were observed at the same time points?
