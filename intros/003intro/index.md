## Pro-tip: Start distributing your code/analyses

In the past the only way to make yourself known to the outside world was to publish a paper. That is still a really good (__and important__) way to communicate what you are doing. But it isn't the only way. If you do good data analyses and think they are interesting, write them up and post them on your website/your blog/Github. Put up the code so other people can see it, build on it, and get to know your work. The best known students are the ones who have great papers and the ones who produce/share interesting analyses/code.

## Paper of the day


[Identifying Influential and Susceptible Members of Social Networks](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/337/6092/337.full?sid=32ccd8a6-2f19-4630-ac27-8b74df041b6b)

Identifying social influence in networks is critical to understanding how behaviors spread. We present a method that uses in vivo randomized experimentation to identify influence and susceptibility in networks while avoiding the biases inherent in traditional estimates of social contagion. Estimation in a representative sample of 1.3 million Facebook users showed that younger users are more susceptible to influence than older users, men are more influential than women, women influence men more than they influence other women, and married individuals are the least susceptible to influence in the decision to adopt the product offered. Analysis of influence and susceptibility together with network structure revealed that influential individuals are less susceptible to influence than noninfluential individuals and that they cluster in the network while susceptible individuals do not, which suggests that influential people with influential friends may be instrumental in the spread of this product in the network.
