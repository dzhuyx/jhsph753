## Pro-tip: 

Fail fearlessly. Learning things is about trying not to fail. Discovering things is about failing all the time and getting back up and trying again. Research is about failing over and over and keeping your spirits up.

## Paper of the day

"There are two cultures in the use of statistical modeling to
reach conclusions from data. One assumes that the data are generated
bya given stochastic data model. The other uses algorithmic models and
treats the data mechanism as unknown."
