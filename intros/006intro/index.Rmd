## Pro-tip: 

Don't be afraid to ask lots of (polite) questions. I used to worry about looking dumb. Mostly this just meant I was dumb - because I didn't ask I didn't know what people were talking about. Most of my best research projects have come from asking, "why did you...", "what if you...", "but could you...". Train yourself to furiously curious without being a prosecutor. No smart person will think you are dumb.

## Paper of the day

"You can drop a mouse down a thousand-yard mine shaft; and, on arriving at the bottom, it gets a slight shock and walks away, provided that the ground is fairly soft. A rat is killed, a man is broken, a horse splashes."
