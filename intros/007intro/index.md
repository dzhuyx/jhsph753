## Pro-tip: 

The person who comes to the meeting with the most hard data/work done wins. Most people (your instructor included) are so discombobulated/busy that they will show up with more opinions than facts. If you show up with solid, carefully considered evidence you are way ahead. You will go to a *ton* of meetings in your career. The way to not be disappointed is to be the most prepared person in the room.
