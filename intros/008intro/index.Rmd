## Pro-tip: 

Learn how to write papers in a very clear and simple style. Whenever you can write in plain english and make the approach you are using understandable and clear. This can (sometimes) make it harder to get your papers into journals. But simple, clear language leads to much higher use/citation of your work. Examples of great writers are: John Storey, Rob Tibshirani, Brad Efron, Robert May, Martin Nowak, etc.

## Paper of the day

[Crowdsourcing Graphical Perception: Using Mechanical
Turk to Assess Visualization Design](http://vis.stanford.edu/files/2010-MTurk-CHI.pdf)


In this paper, we assess the viability of Amazonâ€™s Mechanical Turk as a platform for graphical perception experiments. We replicate previous studies of spatial encoding and luminance contrast and compare our results. We also conduct new experiments on rectangular area perception (as in treemaps or cartograms) and on chart size and gridline spacing. Our results demonstrate that crowdsourced perception experiments are viable and contribute new insights for visualization design.
